A simple demonstration of calculating weekly payment

/**
 * A general abstract class for the service of calculating per-week payment, 
 * according to the following (default) rules:
 * 
 *For hours within {@value #constHoursThresholdExtraPay}, pay by base hourly salary. 
 *For hours over {@value #constHoursThresholdExtraPay}, pay by {@value #constTimesExtraPay} 
 *times of base hourly salary
 * 
 * Following conditions are considered error, and error code is to be returned.
 *    > Hourly base salary less than minimum which is {@value #constMinPayPerHour}.
 *    > Total working hour exceeding maximum which is {@value #constMaxHoursPerWeek}.
 *    
 * Limitation: if both error conditions are met, only the error code for the prior error 
 * is returned.
 *    
 * Sub-classes can use default rules, or assign customized parameters to the protected 
 * variables, or even override public methods to provide different rules and calculation.

The class is designed targeting as re-usable APIs, so the calculation result and the status is returned in a wrapper class, instead of directly printing it to System.out.

A demo main() method exists in demo/PayCalcDemo.java, for both default and customized payment calculation.

JUnit testing for normal input, error input and boundary tests.
